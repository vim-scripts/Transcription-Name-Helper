" Transcription Name Helper
" tra.vim v0.3
"
" A nice little script to write scripts (as in medical transcription, not vim
" scripts).
"
" This script allows the user to press <Tab> and in some modes ` to insert two newlines and the
" name of the next person to speak.
"
" NB, Personally, I put this in ~/.vim/ftplugin/ so that only *.tra files are
" affected.
"
" Changes in v0.3
" 	- New modes implemented
" 	- Emtpy line behaviour now changed
"
" Plans for the future include: 
" 	Perhaps a way to read from the *.tra file what to call everyone

" TODO fix the default mode to something. Bug test. Prepare for upload
" Optional: # could be a signal for tra.vim to read the tra file for the name " e.g.
" #transcriptionID1=PIDxxx
" or something like that. tra.vim would read that and make it happen!

" They are outside the function so that the user can define them with
" the :let command. Feel free to just change them here if you're going
" to be using them a lot.

" Before PrintMe() prints a name, it goes into normal mode and this is the key

" want a, there's no way to tell really. I usually choose a as the cursor goes
" back a character when <Esc> is pressed.

" I made this function partially to save me typing this line again and again
