This script allows the user to switch to the next speaker by pressing <Tab> during transcription in insert mode. E.g.

    INTERVIEWER: Blah blah blah?

User presses <Tab> and...

    INTERVIEWER: Blah blah blah?

    INTERVIEWEE1:

To change the names of the people, :let transcriptionID0 = "firstperson" , :let transcriptionID1 = "second person" etc.. Alternatively, change the default names by editing the appropriate variables in tra.vim.

When <Tab> is pressed multiple times in a row, tra.vim replaces the previous transcriptionee's name.

Multiple INTERVIEWEE's are supported as of v0.2. Simply press <Tab> multiple times and the current transcriptionee will change (up to g:maxPersons). To change the number of transcriptionees, simply :let maxPersons = people in interview. Currently, up to 5 transcriptionees are supported.

v0.3 introduces 'modes' for multiple transcriptionees: tabspam, conversation and absolute. To change the transcriptionMode, press <F6>. Tabspam is described in the previous paragraph. Conversation allows <Tab> to toggle between INTERVIEWER and INTERVIEWEE1 and ` toggle between INTERVIEWEE2 and INTERVIEWEE1. Absolute yields: <Tab> = INTERVIEWER; <S-Tab> = INTERVIEWEE1, ` = INTERVIEWEE2; ¬ (or <S-`>) = INTERVIEWEE3.

PS I just realized, those keys might not be ideal for a US keyboard. If you want them changing (I can't remember where ` and ¬ are on a US keyboard offhand) just write in the wiki about it
