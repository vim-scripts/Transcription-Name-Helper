This script allows the user to switch to the next speaker by pressing <Tab> during transcription in insert mode. E.g.

    INTERVIEWER: Blah blah blah?

User presses <Tab> and...

    INTERVIEWER: Blah blah blah?

    INTERVIEWEE1:

To change the names of the people, :let tP1 ,:let tP2 etc.. Alternatively, change the default names by editing the appropriate variables in tra.vim.

<Tab> behaviour has changed slightly (as of v0.2). Basically, if there's no speech in the previous line, it gets replaced by the next speaker on the list.

Multiple INTERVIEWEE's are supported as of v0.2. Simply press <Tab> multiple times and the current INTERVIEWEE will change up to (maxPersons - 1). To change the number of INTERVIEWEEs, simply :let maxPersons = people in interview. Currently, and INTERVIEWER and 4 INTERVIEWEEs are supported.
